# Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks I created while learning core Machine Learning algorithms. Each notebook focuses on a specific concept or model, with hands-on examples, explanations, and visualizations.

## Contents

Here's a quick overview of what's included:

- **Linear Regression**  
  Predicting continuous outcomes using simple and multivariate regression techniques.

- **Logistic Regression**  
  Binary classification using logistic models and performance evaluation.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  Instance-based learning for classification and regression tasks.

- **Decision Trees & Random Forests**  
  Tree-based models for classification and regression, including ensemble techniques.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
  Margin-based classification for linear and non-linear problems.

- **K-Means Clustering**  
  Unsupervised learning for discovering patterns and groupings in data.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Dimensionality reduction and data visualization using PCA.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  Basic text processing, vectorization, and sentiment analysis.

- **Recommender Systems**  
  Building simple recommendation engines using collaborative filtering and similarity metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- NLTK  (for NLP notebooks)

## Note

These projects are for learning and reference purposes. Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on understanding the **"why"** and **"how"** behind each algorithm, rather than just applying libraries.
